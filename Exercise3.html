            <ol>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">Turn off your computer and disconnect the power cord. This ensures your protection.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">Moving your PC to a well-ventilated area is a smart idea; otherwise, whatever dust you remove will settle back on the machine.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">The top and bottom of a case are generally the dirtiest since here is where the dust accumulates. Wipe the outside of your case with a damp cloth.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">A can of compressed air is the best tool for dust removal.
                    Remove the case's side or front panels, then use compressed air to clean the dust from any dust filters. Any noticeable dust accumulations at the bottom of the case may be wiped away, or if you're really cautious, a vacuum can do the trick.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">If you know how to disassemble your components, it's a good idea to empty the case and blow out any dust with brief bursts of air.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">Prior to reassembling your system, it is essential to do some cable management to ensure that the air flowing through your system is as clean as possible. 
                    Additionally, you may pressurize your case to reduce the quantity of dust that accumulates before your next clean.</li>
            </ol>
            <em><b><p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: white; text-indent: 35px;"> Cleaning the hardware on your computer helps the whole system work more smoothly and allows it to operate for a longer period of time.</p></b></em>

        <h2 style="font-family:Courier New; color: #3aafa9 ">CLEANING YOUR SYSTEM</h2>
            <ol>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">A smart way to declutter your computer's interior is to remove any files that you no longer need or to store them to a USB drive or cloud storage. This will free up a significant amount of space on your computer.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">The majority of PCs come preconfigured with apps that may take up a lot of space and significantly slow down your PC. Remove any programs or applications that you haven't used in a long time. </li>        
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">Clearing your browser's history, cache, and cookies is always a good idea. Clearing your browser history on a regular basis ensures that your browser does not retain an excessive amount of information.</li>      
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">After you've erased a large number of files, it's a good idea to empty the trash. However, keep in mind that after the trash is emptied, any data in the trash are permanently deleted.</li>
                <li style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 10pt; color: white;">Reinstalling Windows is an excellent technique to boost your PC's performance and eliminate any virus or system issues. Before reinstalling Windows, make a backup of your personal data.</li>                                              
            </ol>
            <em><b><p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size: 12pt; color: white; text-indent: 35px;">It is essential to clean the hard disk, as well as to update software and uninstall any older applications that have accumulated. </p></b></em>
