        <b><h2 style=" color:#E93479">Bearbrick: Everything You Need to Know</h2></b>
        <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Today, the 'bear' is a famous emblem in both fashion and art. It is a clever design that combines the simplicity of a plastic toy with the aesthetic impressionability of contemporary art and dynamic luxury fashion.

            Bearbrick is a one-of-a-kind vinyl toy that has been one of the most sought-after collectibles since its inception over two decades ago. Although it is a basic plastic toy, it has been used by some of the world's most prestigious fashion firms and designers to exhibit their newest concepts and initiatives.
            
            Considering the quite expensive price, the bear-shaped plastic figure is quite desirable to collectors. Additionally, some of these are sold at auctions for tens of thousands of dollars. This is why it was frequently labeled a "adult collectable toy" by American singer Joe Hahn.
            
            Bearbrick is available in a variety of sizes. The standard one is 70mm tall, which is often referred as as 100% on the size scale. Bearbricks measuring 35mm, or 50%, are often offered as keychains. Greater sizes include 280 mm (400%) and 700 mm (1000%), the latter of which is the biggest Bearbrick size available. The majority of collectors favor the 400% and 1000% sizes.
            
            Vinyl toys are little more than basic plastic figures, yet they have had a profound effect on the toy business.</p>

            <b><h2 style=" color:#E93479">Who is the creator of Bearbrick?</h2></b>
            <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Tatsuhiko Akashi, who started the Japanese business Medicom Toy in 1996, produced Bearbrick. Kubrick, a Lego-like humanoid figure named after famed director Stanley Kubrick, was one of Medicom Toy's initial innovations.

            Bearbrick was made by Akashi for the 2001 World Character Convention in Tokyo, after organizers contacted him about creating a toy to give away as a present to guests. However, the organizers made a last-minute request for hundreds more toys.

            As a result, Akashi, inspired by the fact that the teddy bears soft toy — which generations of children have played with — was celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2000, came up with the notion of putting a bear's head on a Kubrick's body.

            Thus, on 27 May 2001, Medicom Toy introduced Bearbrick, which has evolved into a cherished artefact rather than a toy.

            According to a 2017 interview with Otaku Mode, Akashi does not perform market research. "If I had, this would not have came out," he remarked, pointing to a Bearbrick. There is no way we would have released this."

            Indeed, Bearbrick is so simple that its amazing appeal baffles the majority.</p>

           <b><h2 style=" color:#E93479">Which well-known names have been associated with Bearbrick?</h2></b>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">At the time of its first release, Japan's Medicom Toy collaborated with Tokyo's HMV record store to create a one-of-a-kind Bearbrick. That was the beginning of our partnership.

            Since then, the business has released limited-edition versions of the toy to commemorate holidays such as Halloween and Christmas, as well as cartoon and comic book characters such as Winnie the Pooh, the Avengers, and Star Wars.
            
            Medicom Toy collaborated on special Bearbrick releases with Chanel, Nike, X-Large, Hermès, Comme Des Garçons, Bape, CLOT, Levis, Stüssy, and Undercover, among other well-known fashion and streetwear companies.
            
            Along with music groups such as Daft Punk and Sandaime J Soul Brothers, designers like as Yue Minjun, Takashi Murakami, KAWS, and Hebru Brantley have launched their own Bearbrick collections.</p>

           <b><h2 style=" color:#E93479">What are some of Bearbrick's most well-known designs?</h2></b>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Yue Minjun's 'Qiu Tu' 1000 percent Bearbrick, introduced in 2008, remains the most expensive Bearbrick ever sold, fetching GBP 126,000 at an auction a few years ago.</p>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">The KAWS blue bear-shaped 'Chomper' version, which has the artist's signature 'X' mark on the eyes, is one of the most immediately recognisable Bearbricks.</p>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Colette, a Parisian shop, designed a unique Bearbrick in 2007 to commemorate its tenth anniversary – a basic white bear with the signatures of twelve street artists, including Michael Lau and KAWS.</p>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Colette was also engaged in the production of the limited-edition My First Bearbrick B@BY. Bearbrick is a one-of-a-kind product designed by Japanese actress Chiaki Kuriyama. It has a translucent tummy filled with colored beads. When shook, it produces a rattling sound that is extremely appealing to infants.
                                                Colette also offered Bearbricks labeled "White Crystal Christmas" in 2009 for around USD 14,000 each. Swarovski crystals were inserted in these incredibly rare collectibles</p>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Among the most sought-after Bearbricks is one created by Karl Lagerfeld in 2007. Only 1,000 pieces were created, which were exhibited at the stores of the premium fashion name.
                                                The Bearbrick was dressed in Coco Chanel's characteristic tweed outfit and pearls. It was established to raise funds for the Hong Kong Blood Cancer Foundation's 'Love is Big, Love is Bearbrick' event. One of them sold for roughly USD 30,000 in November 2019 at a Christie's auction.
            </p>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Recent products include the Readymade x Mickey Mouse 1000 percent Bearbrick, which features the collectable toy Mickey Mouse. The plastic figure is distinctive in that it can be clothed in Ghillie suit, a kind of military attire inspired by the Japanese business Readymade's repurposed military surplus clothes.</p>
           <p style="white; text-indent: 10px;">Latest editions include a limited-edition wooden Bearbrick designed by Medicom in partnership with renowned Japanese furniture manufacturer Karimoku. Though Karimoku has previously collaborated with Medicom to offer Bearbricks, this is the first time they have published a 1000 percent scale Bearbrick.</p>
